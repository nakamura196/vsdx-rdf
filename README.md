================

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

vsdx-rdf is a Python library for extracting RDF data from Visio files
(.vsdx). It is based on the [vsdx](https://pypi.org/project/vsdx/)
library, which is a Python library for reading and writing Visio files.

## Install

``` sh
pip install git+https://github.com/nakamura196/vsdx-rdf.git
```

## How to use

In the following example, we extract RDF data from a Visio file and
print it.

``` python
INPUT_FILE = "./data/input/sample/*.vsdx"
OUTPUT_FILE = "./data/output"

Client.convert(INPUT_FILE, OUTPUT_FILE)
```

    Processing: ./data/input/sample/ex.vsdx

`is_download` is a flag that specifies whether to download the linked
RDF data. If `is_download` is `True`, the linked RDF data is downloaded
and stored in output files.

``` python
INPUT_FILE = "./data/input/sample/*.vsdx"
OUTPUT_FILE = "./data/output_extra"

Client.convert(INPUT_FILE, OUTPUT_FILE, is_download=True)
```

    Processing: ./data/input/sample/ex.vsdx
